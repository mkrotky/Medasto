# Medasto
Python API for the Medasto System (www.medasto.de).

Please note: In order to put the python scripts to work you'll need a valid user account 
for the Medasto System. 

MeDaSto is the short cut for “Media Data Storage”. It is an Asset & Shot Management System for Film and 
consists of client applications for Windows/Mac and the Medasto Online Services which can be viewed as a 
central master archive containing all project related data and files. 

This API provides the most commonly used features of the GUI client applications. You might want to use 
it for one of the following reasons:

-Integrate Medasto into your production pipeline 
-Automate reoccurring tasks. 
-Batch import / export data. 

It is assumed that you’re familiar with the basic concepts and features of Medasto. The documentation in the 
script files makes intensive use of Medasto related terms. 


Quick start:
1) Make sure you have a valid user account (otherwise have a look at www.medasto.de).
2) Download at least the ‘medasto’ folder. 
3) Start reading THE COMPLETE introduction in the module ‘medasto/clientservice.py’. There you will also find 
   a simple 4 line example how to get started with your first script. This module contains all public methods 
   which can be used to interact with the Medasto server. Browsing these methods and reading their documentation 
   will give you an overview which features are provided. 


Feel free to modify the scripts according to your needs. Feedback and bug reports are welcome.
