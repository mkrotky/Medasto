Release Notes

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V 2.0.0:

- Added methods update_shotjob_uploadpreview() and update_assetjob_uploadpreview() to the ClientService class.
Since Medasto V 2.x you can provide a separate file for the preview creation instead of letting Medasto
automatically use the media from the original upload.

- Added to all upload*() methods the boolean parameter 'createPreview'.

- Removed the field 'uploadComplete' from the class 'Appendage'. Please use the field 'isonline'
 in order to check the media status.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V 1.1.0:

- removed the constant MEDIATYPE_IMAGESEQ from the medasto.constants module because this type of media is now identified
by the new constant constants.APPENDAGE_TYPE_IMAGESEQ

- Introduced the 3 new APPENDAGE_TYPE_ constants FILE, FOLDER and IMAGESEQ. Because now it is also possible to upload
a folder structure with several sublevels the methods for adding an Appendage need to know which type of data to
expect. The arguments of the affected methods will refer to this constants.

- Added methods update_shotjob_uploadfolder() and update_assetjob_uploadfolder() to the ClientService class.

- Added the field `appendagetype` to the class domain.Appendage which can hold one of the previously mentioned
APPENDAGE_TYPE_* constants.

- Added the new methods download_assetfolder() and download_shotfolder() to the ClientService class.
